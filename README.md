### PFNN
Phase Funtioned Neural Network with CMake support and keyboard controlling support.
Original project: https://github.com/sreyafrancis/PFNN
I found it difficult to build and debug this project due to its amount of dependencies and poor(actaully no) support for keyboard.
So I grabbed all the denpendices and wrote a CMakeLists for it.
And changed some source code to support keyboard controlling.
